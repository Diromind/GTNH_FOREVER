GTNH FOOOREEEVVVEEER
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jb3y2465Qpg

Platform to write code snippets for GTNH more easily and compute them on server.

Flow:
- Form HTTP request with raw data
- Process it on GTNH_FOREVER running instance
- If needed, trigger actions on other platforms
- Return answer and show in-game

We prefer server-side rendering, which means it's better to have ready-to-go answer in response

Currently can interact with:
- Telegram
